## 💡 Notes for You

### The Secret Phrases (KEEP THIS PRIVATE!):
Your Easter egg triggers on these phrases (typed in code editor):
- "ready player one"
- "warren robinett"
- "easter egg"
- "atari adventure"

**These are NOT in the public README** - users have to figure them out! 🎮

### Developer Docs (CLAUDE.md):
CLAUDE.md still has some technical references for future developers/AI assistants. This is fine - it's meant for development, and the casual user won't read it.
