# 🎉 Updates Complete!

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Theme Colors Fixed**
- ✅ CSS variable names corrected (`--accent1`, `--accent2`, `--accent3` instead of `--acc1`, `--acc2`, `--acc3`)
- ✅ All color gradients now use proper `rgba()` format with decimal opacity
- ✅ No more "string did not match expected pattern" errors
- ✅ All three themes (Sunset, Night, Neon) now work correctly

### 2. **Color Gradient System Updated**
- ✅ Replaced hex opacity appending (`${color}44`) with proper rgba values
- ✅ Used `ctx.globalAlpha` for additional opacity control
- ✅ Sky gradient uses hardcoded rgba for reliability
- ✅ Sun and halo use theme colors correctly
